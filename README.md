Task: Create Table Form Using HTML/CSS

For the table setup, the HTML `<table>` tag was employed to establish the structure. Column headers were defined using `<th>` tags, while student data was presented utilizing `<tr>` and `<td>` tags. Basic CSS styling was applied to enhance the appearance, including adjustments to background colors and padding. To ensure the table was centered horizontally on the webpage, the `<center>` tag was utilized. This approach creates a structured table format suitable for displaying student mark sheets with organized headers, clear data presentation, simple styling, and centered alignment.
