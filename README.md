Task 3: Create the table form Using Html,Css

1. Table Setup:
   - The code begins with setting up an HTML table structure to present student mark sheets.
   - It uses the <table> tag to define the table.
   - Inside, it separates the table head (<thead>) for column headers and table body (<tbody>) for data rows.

2. Column Headers:
   - Column headers are defined using <th> tags within the <thead> section.
   - Each <th> tag represents a different subject: "Name", "Maths", "Science", "English", "Physics", and "General Knowledge".
   - These headers provide context for the data presented in each column.

3. Data Presentation:
   - Student data is presented within the <tbody> section using <tr> (table row) and <td> (table data) tags.
   - Each <tr> represents a student's record.
   - Within each <tr>, <td> tags are used to specify individual data cells containing student names and their marks in various subjects.

4. Styling:
   - Simple CSS styling is applied inline to the column headers (<th> tags) to enhance visual appeal.
   - Background color and padding are adjusted for better readability and differentiation.

5. Center Alignment:
   - The entire table is centered horizontally using the <center> tag, which is placed outside the table structure.
   - This ensures the table is centrally aligned on the webpage for a neat presentation.
